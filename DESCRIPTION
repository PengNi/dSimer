Description: dSimer is an R package which provides eight function-based
        methods for disease similarity calculation. These eight methods
        take advantage of diverse biological data which calculate
        disease similarity from different perspectives. The disease
        similarity matrix obtained from these eight methods can also be
        visualized by dSimer.
