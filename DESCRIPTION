Description: dSimer is an R package which provides eight function-based methods 
  for disease similarity calculation. These eight methods take advantage of 
  diverse biological data which calculate disease similarity from different 
  perspectives. The disease similarity matrix obtained from these eight methods
  can also be visualized by dSimer.
