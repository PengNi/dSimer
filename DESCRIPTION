Description: dSimer is an R package which provides computation of nine 
        methods for measuring disease-disease similarity, including a 
        standard cosine similarity measure and eight function-based 
        methods. The disease similarity matrix obtained from these nine 
        methods can be visualized through heatmap and network. Biological 
        data widely used in disease-disease associations study are also 
        provided by dSimer.
