\title{Integration of Disease Similarity Methods}
\description{
dSimer is an R package which provides computation of nine 
methods for measuring disease-disease similarity, including a 
standard cosine similarity measure and eight function-based 
methods. The disease similarity matrix obtained from these nine 
methods can be visualized through heatmap and network. Biological 
data widely used in disease-disease associations study are also 
provided by dSimer.
