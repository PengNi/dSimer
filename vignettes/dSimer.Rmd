# Abstract
Discovering disease-disease simialrties can be useful for us to inferring the mechanisms of complex diseases. And disease similarity has become the important basis in disease-related molecular function research. There have been a number of methods proposed for measuring disease similarity in recent years. But there are lacks of tools or web servers for the computation of these methods.
We present an R package dSimer which provides computation of nine methods for measuring disease-disease similarity, including a standard cosine similarity measure and eight function-based methods. The disease similarity matrix obtained from these nine methods can be visualized through heatmap and network. Biological data widely used in disease-disease associations study are also provided by dSimer.

# Introduction
The quantification of similarity among diseases has drawn more and more attention in modern biology and medicine. Understanding similarity among diseases can not only help us gain deeper insights into complex diseases, but also lead to improvements in disease diagnosis, drug repurposing and new drug development. Due to the growing body of high-throughput biological data such as genomic and proteomic data, a number of methods have been proposed for the computation of similarity among diseases during the past decade.

Here we present dSimer for the calculation of nine disease similarity methods, including one standard cosine similarity method [1, 2] and eight function-based methods which compare disease-related gene set for calculating [3]. Besides, we also implemented methods for the visualization of disease similarity matrix.

To start with dSimer package, type following codes below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dSimer)
help("dSimer")
```

# The standard cosine similarity method
The cosine similarity method is a widely used standard measure in disease association analyses [1, 2]. First it constructs feature vectors for diseases from literature or by using other biological data. Then it calculate the cosine of the angle between normalized vector pairs as the similarity scores between diseases. We implemented function __*CosineDFV*__ for this method:

```{r}
data(d2s_hsdn) #get disease-symptom associations for constructing feature vectors
ds <- sample(unique(d2s_hsdn[,2]), 5) #get disease names sample
simmat <- CosineDFV(ds, ds, d2s_hsdn)
simmat
```

# Function-based methods
## BOG
**BOG** [4] is a method for disease similarity calculating only using disease-gene associations. We designed function __*BOG*__ to implement this method. And for the purpose of normalizing the matrix produced by method BOG, we implemented function __*Normalize*__.
For example:

```{r}
data(d2g_separation) #get disease-gene associations
ds<-sample(names(d2g_separation),5)
ds
sim<-BOG(ds,ds,d2g_separation)
Normalize(sim) #normalize BOG sim scores
```

Note that disease-gene associations __*d2g_separation*__ is a list object that can be obtained by function __*x2y_df2list*__. Function __*x2y_df2list*__ take a data.frame which has two columns (one column contains disease ids and one column contains gene ids, each row declares an association between a disease and a gene) as a input. See an example below:

```{r}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #this may be neccessary
 
d2g_fundo_sample<-read.table(text = "DOID:5218    IL6
DOID:8649  EGFR
DOID:8649	PTGS2
DOID:8649	VHL
DOID:8649	ERBB2
DOID:8649	PDCD1
DOID:8649	KLRC1
DOID:5214	MPZ
DOID:5214	EGR2
DOID:5210	AMH")

d2g_fundo_list<-x2y_df2list(d2g_fundo_sample)
d2g_fundo_list
```

Function __*Normalize*__ normalize a matrix or a vector as the following formula:
$$NormScore=\frac{OrigScore-MinScore}{MaxScore-MinScore}$$

Here's an example:

```{r}
m<-matrix(1:9,3,3)
m
Normalize(m)
```

## PSB
**PSB** [5] uses not only disease-gene associations but also GO-gene associations. We designed function __*PSB*__ to implement this method. Function __*PSB*__ needs disease-GO associations which can be obtained by function __*HypergeometricTest*__.

Here's an example for __*PSB*__:

```{r}
## get the data 
data(go2g_sample)
data(d2go_sample)

ds<-names(d2go_sample)
sim<-PSB(ds,ds,d2go_sample,go2g_sample)
sim
Normalize(sim)
```

## FunSim
**FunSim** [3] is a method that takes advantage of gene function network data from HumanNet [6]. First we got the raw data from HumanNet, then we normalized the associated log likelihood score of gene pairs. Then we can use function __*FunSim*__ to mearsure similarity between diseases (note that we use function __*LLSn2List*__ to convert HumanNet data from data.frame to list, for more efficient calculating):

```{r}
## in this method, we must use disease-gene associations 
## which genes are represented by entrez ids because of
## HumanNet
data(d2g_fundo_entrezid) ##get disease-gene associations
data(HumanNet_sample)
## we specified 5 DOIDs to match Human_sample
ds<-c("DOID:8176","DOID:2394","DOID:3744","DOID:8466","DOID:5679")
llsnlist<-LLSn2List(HumanNet_sample)
FunSim(ds,ds,d2g_fundo_entrezid,llsnlist)
```

## ICod
**ICod** [7] mearsures disease-disease similarities based on disease-related PPIs. We used an R graph __*igraph*__ to import PPI data into R.
For example:

```{r}
## get disease-gene associations and HPRD PPI data
data(d2g_fundo_symbol)
data(PPI_HPRD)

graph_hprd<-graph.data.frame(PPI_HPRD,directed=FALSE) #get a igraph object based on HPRD PPI data

ds<-sample(names(d2g_fundo_symbol),5)
ICod(ds,ds,d2g_fundo_symbol,graph_hprd)
```

## Sun's measures
Sun [8] proposed three measures which use different biological information. These three measures are: annotation-baesd, function-based and topological-based.

### Sun's annotation-based measure
**Sun's annotation-based measure** used the information of disease-gene association data. We implemented function __*Sun_annotation*__ to calculate disease-disease similarity:

```{r}
data(d2g_separation) ## get disease-gene associations

ds<-sample(names(d2g_separation),5)
Sun_annotation(ds,ds,d2g_separation)
```

### Sun's function-based measure
**Sun's function-based measure** uses both GO term annotations and disease-gene associations to estimate the disease similarity scores. We implemented function __*Sun_function*__ to perform this method like follows:

```{r}
## get a sample of disease-GO associations
data(d2go_sample)
ds<-names(d2go_sample)
Sun_function(ds,ds,d2go_sample)
```

### Sun's topology-based measure
**Sun's topology-based measure** takes advantage of the topology of PPI network and disease-gene association data to measure disease similarity scores. Futhurmore Function __*Sun_topology*__ was implemented for this method. And in this method, the graphlet signature of nodes in PPI were calculated by a tool **orca** [9] (see details in [8]).

Here is an example:

```{r}
data(d2g_fundo_symbol)
data(graphlet_sig_hprd) #get graphlet signatures of genes in HPRD PPI network
data(weight)
ds<-sample(names(d2g_fundo_symbol),5)
Sun_topology(ds,ds,d2g_fundo_symbol,graphlet_sig_hprd,weight)
```

## Separation
Method **Separation** is actually a method measuring a netowrk-based separation of disease pairs [10]. But the result can also be turned into similarity scores. And we implemented function __*Separation2Similarity*__ for this purpose as the following formula:
$$SimScore=\frac{MaxSepScore-SepScore}{MaxSepScore-MinSepScore}$$

Here is an example:

```{r}
## get the disease-gene association data and interactome data
data(d2g_separation)
data(interactome)

## import ppi data to R by igraph
graph_interactome<-graph.data.frame(interactome,directed=FALSE)

## calculate separation of 5 sample diseases
ds<-sample(names(d2g_separation),5)
sep<-Separation(ds,ds,d2g_separation,graph_interactome)

## convert separation into simialrity
sim<-Separation2Similarity(sep)
sim
```

# Visualization
## Visualization of disease-gene associations
Disease-gene associations are the most widely used information to measure disease similarity in function-based methods. Here we provide function __*plot_bipartite*__ for users to observe associations between diseases and genes more intuitively. This function can also visualize other associations like disease-GO term associations. 
Here's an example:

```{r}
data(d2g_fundo_symbol)
d2g_sample<-d2g_fundo_symbol[1:10]
plot_bipartite(d2g_sample)
```

## Visualization of disease similarity network
We implemented two functions __*plot_heatmap*__ and __*plot_net*__ for the disease similarity network's visualization. Function __*plot_heatmap*__ is a reuse of function __*simplot*__ in package **DOSE** [11] which shows the heatmap of disease similarity network. Given a cutoff, function __*plot_net*__ will show the relationships among diseases in a graph.
For example:

```{r}
data(d2g_separation)
data(interactome)

graph_interactome<-graph.data.frame(interactome,directed=FALSE)
ds<-c("myocardial ischemia","myocardial infarction","coronary artery disease",
 "cerebrovascular disorders","arthritis, rheumatoid","diabetes mellitus, type 1",
 "autoimmune diseases of the nervous system","demyelinating autoimmune diseases, cns",
 "respiratory hypersensitivity","asthma","retinitis pigmentosa",
 "retinal degeneration","macular degeneration")
 
sep<-Separation(ds,ds,d2g_separation,graph_interactome)
sim<-Separation2Similarity(sep)
plot_heatmap(sim,font.size = 3)
plot_net(sim,cutoff=0.2)
```
